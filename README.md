# TMaze
The Google Colabatory notebook, [Demo.ipynb](https://github.com/annikaheuser/TMaze/blob/main/Demo.ipynb), demonstrates how we produced the experimental materials for our validation experiment. More details about the experiment, as well as the implementation of TMaze, can be found in [Heuser, 2022](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/147233). 

The package from which we sourced the large lanaguage model, [mlm-scoring](https://github.com/awslabs/mlm-scoring), requires CUDA, which Google Colab has pre-installed. Therefore, anyone, no matter their hardware, can run TMaze on a Google Colab. Special thanks to Kyle Vedder for help in setting up the notebook environment to be compatible with the mlm-scoring package. 

Collaborations to improve this codebase (and therefore also pull requests) are welcome, as are inquiries about adjusting TMaze to your experiment.
